    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
      <strong>L</strong>anguage or HTML is the standard
      <em>markup language</em>
      for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
      meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
      such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
      JavaScript.

      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      its appearance.

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
      meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
      such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
      JavaScript.

    <p>
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
      the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
      lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
      tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and
      <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Browsers do not
      display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag.</li>
      <li>The closing tag.</li>
      <li>The actual element.</li>
    </ol>
