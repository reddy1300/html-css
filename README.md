**HTML:** HTML is responsible for the content of the page. SO that's the text, the images, the button, and really all the
content that we see on a webpage is always written inside an HTML file.

- Represents Nouns for ex p element represent paragraph. So paragraph is the noun here.

**CSS:** CSS, is responsible for the representation of the content, so basically for styling and for laying out the elements
on the webpage.

- The CSS then is the adjective because it basically describe the noun, for ex, like this piece of CSS saying that the
  paragraph text is red. And so red is the adjective describing the noun.

**JS:** JavaScript is the actual programming language of the frontend. So it allows us to add dynamic and interactive effects
to web pages. We can also use it to manipulate the content or the CSS to load data from web servers and even to bulid entire
front-end applications. which we then call web applications.

- JS describe the verb. for ex, hide the paragraph. So we are actually doing something.

**index.html** This is the default name of the first page of any website. So index is basically always the entry point to
anywebsite, and so all web projects always need to have an index.html.
